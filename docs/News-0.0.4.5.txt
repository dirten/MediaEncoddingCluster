Media Encoding Cluster 0.0.4.5 Released

Media Encoding Cluster is the first Open Source Cluster Encoding Solution that is written in  C/C++ for distributed Media(Video and Audio) Encoding.

Media Encoding Cluster is an extensible video encoder, which uses a lightweight peer-to-peer grid to leverage the processing power of regular PCs for the purpose of distributing the encoding of highly compressed video, for example MPEG4 and H.264

It distributes Video Chunks over the Network to Client Nodes and parallelize the Encoding Task for one File over even more than one Computer to reduce the Encoding Time per File.

This Release have many solved bugs and performance issues but it is allways in an alpha state, please feel free to Download the Media Encoding Cluster from http://codergrid.de/index.php/downloads and test this out.

If you find something not working as expected, or you have suggestions about ways to improve the current build, please open a new Ticket or using our Forum.
